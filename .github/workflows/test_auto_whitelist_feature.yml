name: Test Auto-Whitelist Feature

# This workflow tests the auto_whitelist feature using the real-world pattern:
# 1. Setup step: Start EDAMAME with auto_whitelist enabled (connected mode)
# 2. Do work: Generate traffic (daemon captures in background)
# 3. Teardown step: Dump sessions (augments whitelist and uploads artifact)
#
# Uses connected mode to bypass IP allow list for artifact download/upload
# This mimics how users would use it in production workflows

      # ============================================================
      # STEP 3: Teardown - Dump sessions (like release_macos_standalone.yml:253-256)
      # Automatically augments whitelist and uploads artifact
      # 
      # EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
      # - Iterations 1-N (learning/evolving): Whitelist exceptions are EXPECTED
      #   * New endpoints are being discovered and added
      #   * Action automatically allows exceptions (does NOT fail)
      #   * Endpoint count should increase or stay stable (not decrease)
      # 
      # - Iterations N+1 to N+3 (confirming stability): 
      #   * No new endpoints discovered (0% change)
      #   * Action still allows exceptions (still NOT failing)
      #   * Counting consecutive stable runs (1/3, 2/3, 3/3)
      # 
      # - Iteration N+4+ (stable/enforcing): Whitelist is STABLE
      #   * Action automatically ENFORCES whitelist (WILL fail on exceptions)
      #   * Any new endpoint = supply chain attack detected
      #   * Workflow fails to protect against unauthorized connections
      # 
      # KNOWN ISSUE (Core Implementation):
      # - Endpoint counts may fluctuate instead of monotonically increasing
      # - This indicates augment-custom-whitelists is creating fresh whitelists
      #   instead of merging exceptions with existing whitelist
      # - This is a CORE bug, not an action bug
      # - The action correctly downloads, applies, and calls augment-custom-whitelists
      # - The daemon should be merging but appears to be replacing instead
      # 
      # The action automatically detects auto-whitelist mode from first invocation
      # and uses saved configuration - NO parameters need to be repeated here!
